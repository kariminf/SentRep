A simple description of this project is: sentences (text) morphological and lexical annotation.
A more focus is on morphology such as verbs tense, modality, etc.

The project aims to afford:
* A universal mechanism to represent different morphological aspects of natural languages, and some lexical ones too.
* API's to transform from a language (formal or natural) to the universal representation and vis-versa.
* Parsers for formal languages designed for morphological and lexical representation.
These parsers use the universal morphology proposed in this project.
* Generators for the same formal languages.

## Universal types

Some mechanisms to reppresent:
* Comparison,
* Determiners,
* Pronouns,
* Verb modality
* verb tense
* Relations between clauses and phrases: relative clause (the man who walk), Adpositional phrases (prepositions) and adverbials (when I woke up).

## Supported representations

As for now the only focus of this project is to improve STON parser.
* STON (Sentence object notation)
